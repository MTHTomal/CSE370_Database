# Donation Management System

#### Project Overview:

One of the biggest challenges in charitable organizations is the lack of transparency in how  
donations are managed and used. This system aims to foster trust, accountability, and  
responsible involvement by offering transparency for managing an orphanage, shelter for the  
homeless or old age home.

### Features:

1. **Visitor Role Selection:**  
   Any site visitor can choose to act as a donor, a volunteer, or both.

2. **Entrusted Donor Access:**  
   A visitor donating above a specified threshold becomes an Entrusted Donor. Entrusted Donors are unlikely to exploit the system because their large contribution implies a genuine interest in transparency, not personal gain. Giving such privileges to anyone could risk creating syndicates or internal manipulation for profit.  
   Entrusted Donors can:  
   - View detailed expense reports (purchases, item cost, source etc.).  
   - Check if funds are spent fairly and raise concerns via a public feedback forum.  
   - Help verify reports, ensuring the system remains corruption-free.

3. **Regular Donor Transparency:**  
   - Regular donors contribute smaller amounts and do not gain access to detailed internal financial data.  
   - They can see general expense summaries like how much was spent on food or medical care today, but not supplier identities or purchase amounts.  
   - **Why restricted access:** Allowing full visibility to everyone opens the risk of manipulation. Someone could donate a small amount repeatedly to access sensitive data and exploit it by forming pricing syndicates with suppliers.

4. **Daily Expense Dashboard:**  
   Displays a breakdown of daily expenses in categories such as: Food, Medical treatment, Repairs and utilities. Keeps the total fund balance and vendor names hidden to prevent misuse.

5. **Community Verification Requests:**  
   Volunteers, regular donors, or visitors can request an Entrusted Donor to verify expense reports. This keeps corruption in check.

6. **Beneficiary Records:**  
   The system tracks details of each orphan or homeless resident, including:  
   - Current needs (clothing, medicine, shelter)  
   - Health conditions  
   - Capacity and occupancy of the shelter

7. **“We Need” Dashboard:**  
   Displays real-time needs of the organization. For example: beds, warm clothes, first-aid etc.  
   Anyone can choose to donate or provide based on listed needs.

8. **Volunteer Skill & Availability Management:**  
   - Filters volunteers by category (Technical, Logistic, Medical).  
   - Volunteers marked “Busy” are removed from the active list.  
   - System auto-finds replacements and can notify them for the scheduled task.

9. **Volunteer Hours & Certificate Generator:**  
   - Tracks how many hours each volunteer has served.  
   - After completing a threshold, the system generates a service certificate which can also help them in future. So win-win for everyone.
